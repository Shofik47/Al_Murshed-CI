				<h2>Profession of Faith</h2>
				<p>The belief that "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God" is central to Islam. This phrase, written in Arabic, is often prominently featured in architecture and a range of objects, including the Qur'an, Islam's holy book of divine revelations. One becomes a Muslim by reciting this phrase with conviction.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The Shahadah (Arabic: ٱلشَّهَادَة‎, About this soundaudio (help·info)) is the first pillar of Islam. It is the saying: "Lā ʾIlāha ʾIllā Allah, Muḥammadun Rasūl Allah", meaning "There no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah".</p>
				<p>Verse 3:18 of the Quran states: "God bears witness that there is no other god besides Him, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge." </p>
				
				 <p>Arabic text: <br/><br/>
					أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ <br/>
					وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ </p>

				<p>English rendering: <br/><br/>
				I bear witness that there is no god but Allah</p>
				<p></p>And I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. </p>
				<p>In addition to the first two testimonies, Shia Muslims may also recite the third testimony of:</p>

				<p>Arabic text: <br/>
				وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِيُّ ٱللَّٰهِ <br/>
				</p>
				<p>English rendering: <br/>
				And I bear witness that Ali is the vicegerent of Allah<br/>
				A single honest recitation of the shahadah in Arabic is all that is required for a person to become a Muslim according to most traditional schools of Islam. </p>
